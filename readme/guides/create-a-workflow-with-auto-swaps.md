# Create a workflow with auto swaps

An auto swap is a proactive action configured by a node operator in anticipation of potential liquidity issues in the future, aiming to restore liquidity to a predefined level. It is executed automatically when the specified trigger conditions are met. Unlike regular swaps that involve a fixed amount, auto swaps are designed to maintain a desired liquidity level as a reference. Auto swap can trigger multiple swaps to restore liquidity to the desired level, ensuring that the channel or node remains adequately funded. For more details, refer to the [docs](https://docs.bolt.observer/readme/liquidops/integrations/actions/perform-auto-swaps) on auto swaps.
