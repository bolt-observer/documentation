# Agent based - push

Our push based system is based on our open source agent [https://github.com/bolt-observer/agent](https://github.com/bolt-observer/agent)

Agent is a program that essentially interfaces between your node and our platform, gathering data from your node's api and converting it to a compatible format for our platform to ingest it.&#x20;
