# LiquidOps

LiquidOps is a product aimed at helping you manage liquidity of your lightning node. We do periodic pulling of data through your nodes API and provide you with configurable alerting on your balances and channel status.



Features:

* alerting on liquidity events
* alerting on channel status
* alerting on new opened channels&#x20;
* alerting on closed channels&#x20;

### Data input

We have two ways to obtain needed data from your node to facilitate alerting, depending on your preferences and risk models
