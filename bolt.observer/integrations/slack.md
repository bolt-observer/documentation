# Slack

To receive notifications on Slack, you first have to set up incoming webhooks on Slack as described [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack).

### Create a new Slack app

Select the workspace in which you prefer to receive notifications.

Once the access is granted, you can copy the webhook URL and insert it into the Slack integration window in bolt.observer
